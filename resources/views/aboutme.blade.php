                    Hello there, I am  <span class="capitalize font-bold "> Shane Jared Medina Sabado</span>, a Web Developer and a creator of this website. I am glad to share you my portfolio website project, and this is the "Story Behind My Career".

                    It all started since 2020, when the pandemic arises, it seems more complex to stay at home and do nothing. So I decided to wake-up late, eat breakfast and lunch as well, watch TV, doing some TikTok dance, and doing a lot of stuff which makes no sense at all. Both of my parents saw what I am doing, and they say they wanted to help me with this bad everyday routine. So one day, my father taught me how to learn the programming which I hate. For me, Programming / Coding is too hard for me and I didn't understand it at all. I don't want to learn, I want to eat, dance, lay down all day long. But I pay attention to what my father's teaching about programming. So I'm curious about it. He teached me the basic HTML and how to show localhost web the simple, "Hello World." And I was amazed by it! I said to him that I'm happy with the result and I want to see something more about it. He showed me next the color output. How to put a background color in it, and I did it too. I was about to jump at that time cause I did it with no hesitancy. I was so happy and I said to myself that I want to do "MORE".

                    Moved on after a week, days, hours of learning HTML (this is the bone or structure of the website), I have the eager to learn the basic CSS (this is where you put styles on the website. Use to design) After had dedication, hard work, and patience, time passes by and I'm now learning the basic javascript (this is the nervous system of the website. Where you are about to do the moving animation functionality etc.) It took 3 working months, studying for about almost 4-5 hours every weekdays and 3 hours every weekends just to learn the javascript from the very basic component up until the complex of it.
                    <br><br>
                    After that, I combined all of them which makes the website more interactive and more user-friendly. With dedication, passion, motivation and hard work, it did a great role to start my career with. While my father said that I'm now learning the deep part of how the website are working. This makes me proud of myself even better.

                    Time flies so fast, after a year that I'm focusing to learn all 3 of it, I decided to study the Frontend, Backend, Database. Again, starts from zero knowledge, with the same power of Dedication, hard work and passion, it called MERN or MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS. From studying this MERN Stack, I'm knowledgable to create a Web-Application which has a complete Register and Login functionality that can do Create, Read, Update and Delete. Here's the old link if you want to explore it. <a href="https://mern-course-jobify-k4ax.onrender.com" class="text-blue-600">&rarr; Mern Course Jobify</a>

                    Every year there's a new update on each technology. So I upgraded my skills too, deep divin' to the one of very popular technology which is the Laravel. I pay attention to learn this technology for almost a year until now. And now, I have the capability to create a website like this.
                    <br><br>
                    This website is created from Laravel 11, Tailwind CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySql for database.

                    I'm proud to say that I didn't go to college just to create this website and it also take me 5 years to take this journey. There's always a time that I felt to give up. When I had a lot of error, solving it for an hours, day or even a week. But my mindset always changing my personality. "I can do it, I can solve it. If other people can do it, then why I can't? I can do it like them. But I'm struggling. What am I supposed to do? I don't know! Maybe quit programming?" But I changed my mindset and proceed to solve it. And I did it! and I'm proud that I did not quit programming! My Mother comes to play a big role in my career. She told me to not give up and gave me a lot of motivation and courage to continue my journey. And I'm thankful for that. Both of my parents are my inspiration to this journey of mine. They're always there to support and guide me to the right path.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm glad that I shared with you'll my story behind my career. I hope you enjoy my website, just all that I can say, "Do not give up." My motto is: "Small changes, makes a big differences." Every changes and mindset you are about to do, just "Keep moving forward." Every error, there is a solution. Every wrong, there is right. And every Failure, there is a success.
